# Introductions
This repository is for new students in the lab! 

The goal of this repo is to get you comfortable with using github throughout your time in the lab. It's important to keep up-to-date code and data files here as your mentor and other students will be able to see your work. 

Start by creating a branch with your name and then open this repo in the IDE of your choice. Ask Prof. G and/or your mentor for suggestions if you are unsure what IDE to use! 
Once you fill out files, trying creating a commit through the IDE or through the Github browser. Push that commit to your branch and document your process :)
